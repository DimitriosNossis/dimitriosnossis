### Hello there 👋

My name is Dimitrios. I am a Physiotherapy Graduate trying to make my way in Software and Game Development!

- 📚 I recently finished CS50x 2024.
- 🕹️ I recently created a mini game called [Pixel Wars](https://souldr.itch.io/pixelwars).
- 🎮 I’m currently familiarising myself with basic Programming Languages.
- 👨‍💻 I’m currently working on a personal project called "Childhood Dreams" in Unreal Engine.
- 🙋‍♂️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that will provide me with experience on Programming.
